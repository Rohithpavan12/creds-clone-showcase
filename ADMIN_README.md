## 🛠️ API Integration (Future)

The admin panel is ready for backend API integration. Current implementation uses localStorage for demo purposes. To connect to a real backend:

1. Update `dataService.ts` to use API calls instead of localStorage
2. Implement JWT token management in `auth.ts`
3. Add API interceptors for authentication
4. Update CORS configuration
